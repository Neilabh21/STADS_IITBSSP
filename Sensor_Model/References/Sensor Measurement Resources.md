Hey all,

Regarding Millen's Question about we can go about measuring the Fixed Pattern Noise, feel free to refer to the following blog which is an extremely good source for information and everything is explained really nicely here.

[Harvest Imaging Blog](http://harvestimaging.com/blog/)

This blog is by Albert J.P. Theuwissen. In 1991 he became Department Head of the division Imaging Devices at Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven (the Netherlands). He is author or co-author of 200+ technical papers in the solid-state imaging field and issued several patents. ([Publications](https://harvestimaging.com/publications.php))

In 2008 Albert Theuwissen received the SMPTE's (Society for Motion Pictures and Television Engineers) Fuji Gold Medal for his contributions in research, development and education in the field of the solid-state image capturing.  

  

For more info, refer to his [Bio](https://harvestimaging.com/bio.php).

  

It is safe to say that this person would have a lot of insights related to CCD and CMOS Sensors.

  

As there are a lot of important blog posts here, I have shared the links to the ones that are relevant in the light of the discussion on the Sensor Model -
